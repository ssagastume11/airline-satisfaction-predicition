# Introduction

This project explores airline passenger satisfaction survey data to understand what factors influence how satisfied travelers feel. By using data from Kaggle, I aim to identify patterns, build a model, and provide useful recommendations to improve airline services.

# Scenario

Airlines rely heavily on feedback to improve customer experience and retain loyal passengers. With this dataset, I can look at survey ratings related to booking, boarding, comfort, and service, and explore how they connect to overall satisfaction.

# Ask

The key questions for this analysis are:

1. What factors are most related to passenger satisfaction?
2. How does satisfaction vary by customer type, travel class, or travel purpose?
3. Can I predict satisfaction using this data?
4. What can airlines do to increase passenger satisfaction?

# Prepare

**Data Source**: Kaggle â€“ Airline Passenger Satisfaction  
Dataset: [Airline Passenger Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)
```{r prepare, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(caret)

# Load and clean
train <- read_csv("Airline Satisfaction Prediction Analysis/train.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-id) %>%
  mutate(across(c(gender, customer_type, type_of_travel, class, satisfaction), as.factor),
         arrival_delay_in_minutes = replace_na(arrival_delay_in_minutes, 0),
         satisfaction_binary = ifelse(satisfaction == "satisfied", 1, 0))
```

# Process
```{r}
# Check for missing values
colSums(is.na(train))

# Final structure

# Analyze
```{r}
# Split and model
set.seed(123)

               flight_distance + inflight_wifi_service + ease_of_online_booking +
               online_boarding + seat_comfort + inflight_entertainment +
               cleanliness + departure_delay_in_minutes + arrival_delay_in_minutes,
             data = train_set, family = binomial)

# Predict and evaluate
pred <- ifelse(predict(model, test_set, type = "response") > 0.5, 1, 0)
confusionMatrix(factor(pred), factor(test_set$satisfaction_binary))
